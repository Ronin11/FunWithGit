Gravity is a simple and cool planetary motion simulator.  To use, run the executable,
or compile the source code yourself.

Controls:

Use the mouse to add bodies to the gravity system.  Click and drag to give them speed
and direction.  You can change the creation settings in the edit menu.  You can speed 
up, slow down, pause, and resume the simulation from the Edit menu as well.

You can take a screenshot of your awesome gravity system with the option under the
File menu. You can also load prebuilt systems with the Change Mode option in the 
File menu.
